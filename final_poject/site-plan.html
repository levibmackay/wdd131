      <h2>Content</h2>

      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        The home page will feature a hero banner with the logo and tagline, a
        short welcome blurb, and a toggle or dropdown menu to choose between
        "Home Workouts" or "Gym Workouts." Based on the selection, workouts will
        display below in card format with name, sets/reps, and a short description.
        A button will allow the user to "Add to Plan," saving the selection to
        <code>localStorage</code>. Responsive layout and modern CSS styling will
        ensure readability and accessibility on all devices.
      </p>

      <h3>Motivation Page</h3>
      <p>
        The second page will focus on motivation and mindset. A JavaScript-powered
        quote generator will show a new quote each time the page is loaded or when
        the user clicks a button. Below, a short list of mental tips (e.g., “Discipline
        over motivation”) will be shown. The user can enter a fitness goal into a form
        that saves to <code>localStorage</code> and is displayed beneath the input.
        This page is built to inspire and help users stay committed.
      </p>
